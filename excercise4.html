    <h1>Mamma Mia</h1>
    <h2>ABBA</h2>
    <p><div>I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul</div></p>
    <p><div>and I can hear a bell ring
    (One more look) and I forget everything, whoa</div></p>
    <p><div><span>Mamma Mia</span>, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you
Mamma Mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you</div></p>
<p><div>Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go
Mamma Mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go</div></p>
<p><div>I've been angry and sad about things that you do
    I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
    And when you go, when you slam the door
    I think you know that you won't be away too long
    You know that I'm not that strong</p></div>
    <p><div>and I can hear a bell ring
(One more look) and I forget everything, whoa</p></div>
<p><div>Mamma Mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you
Mamma Mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you</p></div>
<p><div>Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go
Mamma mia, even if I say
Bye bye, leave me now or never
Mamma Mia, it's a game we play
Bye bye doesn't mean forever</p></div>
<p><div>Mamma Mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you
Mamma Mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you
<p><div>Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go
Mamma Mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go</p></div>
